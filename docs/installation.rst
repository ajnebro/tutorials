Installation quick guide
========================
jMetal is a Maven project hosted in GitHub, so there are two ways of getting the software: adding it as a dependence in your own Maven project, or getting the source code from https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal.

The software requirements to use jMetal 6 are:

* Java 8 JDK 
* Maven
* R (optional)
* Latex (optional)

To work with the jMetal 6.0-SNAPSHOT version, just clone the repository in https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal and checkout the ``jmetal6`` branch.
