Experimental studies
====================

This tutorial briefly describes the features included in jMetal for performing experimental studies related to assessing and comparing the performance of multi-objective algorithms on a set of problems. 

An study includes the execution and subsequent analysis of the results of R independent runs of A algorithms, each of will solve P problems. This process is carried out in three steps: 1) execution of all the configurations, 2) apply quality indicators to the obtained fronts, and 3) performance assessment by using statistical tests and generating stuff summarizing the resuls (e.g., Latex tables, charts).
